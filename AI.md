# AI assistance
AI tools (Copilot, ChatGPT)
- Used Copilot to help fill in code but not very useful as it is often wrong
- ChatGPT helps give ideas for tests and help improve checkstyle compliance
- Used ChatGPT to help write assertion test for my storage class
  - I think doing this has merits for example, it helps me to save time
  - But, in saving time coding, I now have to tweak and understand the code
  - This reduces the time save and reduces the effectiveness
  - I think AI could be more useful if used to write a few lines instead of a whole method
- Assisted in helping me write the program to terminate the app when saying 'bye'
  - Useful as I was unfamiliar with the libraries needed
